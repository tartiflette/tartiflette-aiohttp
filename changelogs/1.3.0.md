# [1.3.0] - 2020-07-31

## Added

* Added a way to hook the response formatting stage of the request execution. Simply register a callable looking like:

```python
def a_method(req: aiohttp.web.Request, data: Dict[str, Any], ctx: Dict[str, Any]) -> aiohttp.web.Response:
     pass
```

This is done via the `register_graphql_handler(..., response_formatter= a_method)`.

## Changed
